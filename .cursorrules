- Follow all coding and contribution standards defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Always use `pnpm` for any command execution or package management tasks.
- When creating new files, ensure the appropriate SPDX license header is included.
- Prioritize workspace-level dependency management as outlined in the root configs.
- Maintain concise, friendly, and professional attitude when assisting with development tasks.
- **CRITICAL**: AI agents MUST execute `pnpm -w fix` after EVERY modification of code or documentation, and before signaling completion, to ensure strict adherence to project standards (linting, formatting, license headers).
