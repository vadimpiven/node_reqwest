Always use pnpm for package management and script execution. Do not use npm or yarn unless explicitly instructed.

Dependencies must always be defined in the workspace root:
- For Node.js, use `catalog:` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- For Rust, use `[workspace.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`.
Packages should then reference these workspace-defined dependencies.

When running tests during development, always use the `dev-test` script (e.g., `pnpm dev-test`) to ensure all configured checks (unit tests, doctests, linting, etc.) are executed.
