Always use pnpm for package management and script execution. Do not use npm or yarn unless explicitly instructed.

Dependencies must always be defined in the workspace root:
- For Node.js, use `catalog:` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- For Rust, use `[workspace.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`.
Packages should then reference these workspace-defined dependencies (e.g., `dependency.workspace = true`).
NEVER add a dependency version directly to a package crate; always add it to the workspace root first.

When running tests during development, always use the `dev-test` script (e.g., `pnpm dev-test`) to ensure all configured checks (unit tests, doctests, linting, etc.) are executed.

All new source files must include the following SPDX identifier at the top:
`SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT`
Use the appropriate comment style for the file type (e.g., `//` for Rust/TS/JS, `#` for TOML/YAML/Shell).

Always place `use` or `import` statements at the top of the file or module.

Prefer `use` statements to specifying namespace when there are no naming conflicts.

Always place the expected value as the first argument in assertions (e.g., `assert_eq!(expected, actual)`).
